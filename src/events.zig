/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `event_filter`: Function originally passed to `events.addWatch()`.
/// * `user_data`: The user data originally passed to `events.addWatch()`.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// This function takes the same input as `events.addWatch()` to identify and delete the corresponding callback.

/// It is safe to call this function from any thread.

/// ## Function Parameters

///
/// ## Version

/// Set up a filter to process all events before they are added to the internal event queue.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `event_filter`: A function to call when an event happens.
/// * `user_data`: User data passed to `event_filter`.
///
/// If you just want to see events without modifying them or preventing them from being queued, you should use `events.addWatch()` instead.
///
/// If the filter function returns true when called, then the event will be added to the internal queue.
/// If it returns false, then the event will be dropped from the queue, but the internal state will still be updated.
/// This allows selective filtering of dynamically arriving events.
///
/// WARNING: Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function, as it may run in a different thread!
///
/// On platforms that support it, if the quit event is generated by an interrupt signal (e.g. pressing Ctrl-C),
/// it will be delivered to the application at the next event poll.
///
/// Note: Disabled events never make it to the event filter function; see `events.enabled()`.
///
/// Note: Events pushed onto the queue with `events.push()` get passed through the event filter, but events pushed onto the queue with `events.peep()` do not.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// It is safe to call this function from any thread.
///
/// ## Version
/// This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.

/// ## Return Value
/// Returns the event popped if `pop_event` is true, otherwise will return `null`.
/// It is not possible to have `pop_event` be true and have this function return `null`.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// If `pop_event` is false, the next event is removed from the queue and returned.
///
/// As this function may implicitly call `events.pump()`, you can only call this function in the thread that initialized the video subsystem.
