/// SDL offers a way to perform I/O asynchronously.
/// This allows an app to read or write files without waiting for data to actually transfer; the functions that request I/O never block while the request is fulfilled.
///
/// Instead, the data moves in the background and the app can check for results at their leisure.
///
/// This is more complicated than just reading and writing files in a synchronous way, but it can allow for more efficiency,
/// and never having framerate drops as the hard drive catches up, etc.
///
/// The general usage pattern for async I/O is:
/// * Create one or more `async_io.Queue` objects.
/// * Open files with `async_io.File.init()`.
/// * Start I/O tasks to the files with `async_io.Queue.readFile()` or `async_io.Queue.writeFile()`, putting those tasks into one of the queues.
/// * Later on, use `async_io.Queue.getResult()` on a queue to see if any task is finished without blocking. Tasks might finish in any order with success or failure.
/// * When all your tasks are done, close the file with `async_io.Queue.CloseFile()`. This also generates a task, since it might flush data to disk!
///
/// This all works, without blocking, in a single thread, but one can also wait on a queue in a background thread, sleeping until new results have arrived:
/// * Call `async_io.Queue.waitResult()` from one or more threads to efficiently block until new tasks complete.
/// * When shutting down, call `async_io.Queue.signal()` to unblock any sleeping threads despite there being no new tasks completed.
///
/// And, of course, to match the synchronous `io_stream.loadFile()`, we offer `async_io.Queue.loadFile()` as a convenience function.
/// This will handle allocating a buffer, slurping in the file data, and null-terminating it; you still check for results later.
///
/// Behind the scenes, SDL will use newer, efficient APIs on platforms that support them: Linux's `io_uring` and Windows 11's `IoRing`, for example.
/// If those technologies aren't available, SDL will offload the work to a thread pool that will manage otherwise-synchronous loads without blocking the app.
///
/// ## Best Practices
/// Simple non-blocking I/O--for an app that just wants to pick up data whenever it's ready without losing framerate waiting on disks to spin--can use whatever pattern
/// works well for the program.
/// In this case, simply call `async_io.Queue.readFile()`, or maybe `async_io.Queue.loadFile()`, as needed.
/// Once a frame, call SDL_GetAsyncIOResult to check for any completed tasks and deal with the data as it arrives.
///
/// If two separate pieces of the same program need their own I/O, it is legal for each to create their own queue.
/// This will prevent either piece from accidentally consuming the other's completed tasks. Each queue does require some amount of resources, but it is not an overwhelming cost.
/// Do not make a queue for each task, however.
/// It is better to put many tasks into a single queue.
/// They will be reported in order of completion, not in the order they were submitted, so it doesn't generally matter what order tasks are started.
///
/// One async I/O queue can be shared by multiple threads, or one thread can have more than one queue, but the most efficient way--if ruthless efficiency is the goal--is to
/// have one queue per thread, with multiple threads working in parallel,
/// and attempt to keep each queue loaded with tasks that are both started by and consumed by the same thread.
/// On modern platforms that can use newer interfaces, this can keep data flowing as efficiently as possible all the way from storage hardware to the app,
/// with no contention between threads for access to the same queue.
///
/// Written data is not guaranteed to make it to physical media by the time a closing task is completed, unless `async_io.closeFile()` is called with its `flush` parameter set to true,
/// which is to say that a successful result here can still result in lost data during an unfortunately-timed power outage if not flushed.
/// However, flushing will take longer and may be unnecessary, depending on the app's needs.

/// Audio functionality for the SDL library.
///
/// All audio in SDL3 revolves around `audio.Stream`.
/// Whether you want to play or record audio, convert it, stream it, buffer it, or mix it, you're going to be passing it through an audio stream.
///
/// Audio streams are quite flexible; they can accept any amount of data at a time, in any supported format, and output it as needed in any other format,
/// even if the data format changes on either side halfway through.
///
/// An app opens an audio device and binds any number of audio streams to it, feeding more data to the streams as available.
/// When the device needs more data, it will pull it from all bound streams and mix them together for playback.
///
/// Audio streams can also use an app-provided callback to supply data on-demand, which maps pretty closely to the SDL2 audio model.
///
/// SDL also provides a simple .WAV loader in `audio.loadWav()` (and `audio.loadWavIo()` if you aren't reading from a file) as a basic means to load sound data into your program.
///
/// ## Logical audio devices
/// In SDL3, opening a physical device (like a SoundBlaster 16 Pro) gives you a logical device ID that you can bind audio streams to.
/// In almost all cases, logical devices can be used anywhere in the API that a physical device is normally used.
/// However, since each device opening generates a new logical device, different parts of the program (say, a VoIP library, or text-to-speech framework,
/// or maybe some other sort of mixer on top of SDL) can have their own device opens that do not interfere with each other;
/// each logical device will mix its separate audio down to a single buffer, fed to the physical device, behind the scenes.
/// As many logical devices as you like can come and go; SDL will only have to open the physical device at the OS level once,
/// and will manage all the logical devices on top of it internally.
///
/// One other benefit of logical devices: if you don't open a specific physical device, instead opting for the default,
/// SDL can automatically migrate those logical devices to different hardware as circumstances change: a user plugged in headphones?
/// The system default changed?
/// SDL can transparently migrate the logical devices to the correct physical device seamlessly and keep playing;
/// the app doesn't even have to know it happened if it doesn't want to.
///
/// ## Simplified Audio
/// As a simplified model for when a single source of audio is all that's needed, an app can use `audio.Device.openStream()`, which is a single function to open an audio device,
/// create an audio stream, bind that stream to the newly-opened device, and (optionally) provide a callback for obtaining audio data.
/// When using this function, the primary interface is the `audio.Stream` and the device handle is mostly hidden away;
/// destroying a stream created through this function will also close the device, stream bindings cannot be changed, etc.
/// One other quirk of this is that the device is started in a paused state and must be explicitly resumed;
/// this is partially to offer a clean migration for SDL2 apps and partially because the app might have to do more setup before playback begins;
/// in the non-simplified form, nothing will play until a stream is bound to a device, so they start unpaused.
///
/// ## Channel Layouts
/// Audio data passing through SDL is uncompressed PCM data, interleaved. One can provide their own decompression through an MP3, etc, decoder,
/// but SDL does not provide this directly.
/// Each interleaved channel of data is meant to be in a specific order.
///
/// Abbreviations:
/// * FRONT = Single mono speaker.
/// * FL = Front left speaker.
/// * FR = Front right speaker.
/// * FC = Front center speaker.
/// * BL = Back left speaker.
/// * BR = Back right speaker.
/// * SR = Surround right speaker.
/// * SL = Surround left speaker.
/// * BC = Back center speaker.
/// * LFE = Low-frequency speaker.
///
/// These are listed in the order they are laid out in memory, so "FL, FR" means "the front left speaker is laid out in memory first, then the front right,
/// then it repeats for the next audio frame":
/// * 1 channel (mono) layout: FRONT
/// * 2 channels (stereo) layout: FL, FR
/// * 3 channels (2.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE
/// * 4 channels (quad) layout: FL, FR, BL, BR
/// * 5 channels (4.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE, BL, BR
/// * 6 channels (5.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR (last two can also be SL, SR)
/// * 7 channels (6.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BC, SL, SR
/// * 8 channels (7.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR
///
/// This is the same order as DirectSound expects, but applied to all platforms; SDL will swizzle the channels as necessary if a platform expects something different.

/// These surfaces can be uploaded to an `render.Texture` or processed as pixels in memory.

/// and some will present a UI asking the user if your application should be allowed to obtain images at all, which they can deny.

/// Applications, after opening a camera device, can see if they were granted access by either polling with the `camera.Camera.getPermissionState()` function,
/// or waiting for an `event.Type.camera_device_approved` or `event.Type.camera_device_denied` event.
/// Platforms that don't have any user approval process will report approval immediately.
///
/// Note that SDL cameras only provide video as individual frames; they will not provide full-motion video encoded in a movie file format,
/// although an app is free to encode the acquired frames into any format it likes.
/// It also does not provide audio from the camera hardware through this API; not only do many webcams not have microphones at all,
/// many people--from streamers to people on Zoom calls--will want to use a separate microphone regardless of the camera.
/// In any case, recorded audio will be available through SDL's audio API no matter what hardware provides the microphone.
///
/// ## Camera Gotchas
/// Consumer-level camera hardware tends to take a little while to warm up, once the device has been opened.
/// Generally most camera apps have some sort of UI to take a picture (a button to snap a pic while a preview is showing,
/// some sort of multi-second countdown for the user to pose, like a photo booth), which puts control in the users' hands,
/// or they are intended to stay on for long times (Pokemon Go, etc).
///
/// It's not uncommon that a newly-opened camera will provide a couple of completely black frames, maybe followed by some under-exposed images.

/// SDL provides access to the system clipboard, both for reading information from other processes and publishing information of its own.
///
/// This is not just text! SDL apps can access and publish data by mimetype.
///
/// ## Basic Use (Text)
/// Obtaining and publishing simple text to the system clipboard is as easy as calling `clipboard.getText()` and `clipboard.setText()`, respectively.
/// These deal with C strings in UTF-8 encoding. Data transmission and encoding conversion is completely managed by SDL.
///
/// ## Clipboard Callbacks (Non-Text)
/// Things get more complicated when the clipboard contains something other than text.
/// Not only can the system clipboard contain data of any type, in some cases it can contain the same data in different formats!
/// For example, an image painting app might let the user copy a graphic to the clipboard, and offers it in .BMP, .JPG, or .PNG format for other apps to consume.
///
/// Obtaining clipboard data ("pasting") like this is a matter of calling `clipboard.getData()` and telling it the mimetype of the data you want.
/// But how does one know if that format is available?
/// `hasData()` can report if a specific mimetype is offered, and `clipboard.getMimeTypes()` can provide the entire list of mimetypes available,
/// so the app can decide what to do with the data and what formats it can support.
///
/// Setting the clipboard ("copying") to arbitrary data is done with `clipboard.setData()`.
/// The app does not provide the data in this call, but rather the mimetypes it is willing to provide and a callback function.
/// During the callback, the app will generate the data.
/// This allows massive data sets to be provided to the clipboard, without any data being copied before it is explicitly requested.
/// More specifically, it allows an app to offer data in multiple formats without providing a copy of all of them upfront.
/// If the app has an image that it could provide in PNG or JPG format, it doesn't have to encode it to either of those unless and until something tries to paste it.
///
/// ## Primary Selection
/// The X11 and Wayland video targets have a concept of the "primary selection" in addition to the usual clipboard.
/// This is generally highlighted (but not explicitly copied) text from various apps.
/// SDL offers APIs for this through `clipboard.getPrimarySelectionText()` and `clipboard.setPrimarySelectionText()`.

/// If you mostly want to think of a pixel as some combination of red, green, blue, and maybe alpha intensities, this is all pretty straightforward,
/// and in many cases, is enough information to build a perfectly fine game.
///
/// However, the actual definition of a pixel is more complex than that:
///
/// Pixels are a representation of a color in a particular color space.
///
/// The first characteristic of a color space is the color type.
/// SDL understands two different color types, RGB and YCbCr, or in SDL also referred to as YUV.
///
/// RGB colors consist of red, green, and blue channels of color that are added together to represent the colors we see on the screen.
///
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model
///
/// YCbCr colors represent colors as a Y luma brightness component and red and blue chroma color offsets.
/// This color representation takes advantage of the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than the color in an image.
/// The Cb and Cr components are often compressed and have lower resolution than the luma component.
///
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr
///
/// When the color information in YCbCr is compressed, the Y pixels are left at full resolution and each Cr and Cb pixel represents an average of the
/// color information in a block of Y pixels.
/// The chroma location determines where in that block of pixels the color information is coming from.
///
/// The color range defines how much of the pixel to use when converting a pixel into a color on the display.
/// When the full color range is used, the entire numeric range of the pixel bits is significant.
/// When narrow color range is used, for historical reasons, the pixel uses only a portion of the numeric range to represent colors.
///
/// The color primaries and white point are a definition of the colors in the color space relative to the standard XYZ color space.
///
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space
///
/// The transfer characteristic, or opto-electrical transfer function (OETF), is the way a color is converted from mathematically linear space into a non-linear output signals.
